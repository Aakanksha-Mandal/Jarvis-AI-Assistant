# JARVIS - AI Assistant

This project is a **personal AI assistant** inspired by JARVIS, built to be genuinely useful rather than just conversational.
It supports natural language chat, persistent task management, deadline-aware summaries, and voice responses.
The assistant is deployed as a live web application using Hugging Face Spaces.
